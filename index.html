        <h1>Purple Mountain Parallax</h1>
        <p> Flattop Mountain is a 3,510 feet (1,070 m) mountain in the U.S. state of Alaska, located in Chugach State Park just east of urban Anchorage. It is the most climbed mountain in the state.

        </p>
           <p> It is usually reached by driving to the Glen Alps trailhead and following a well-maintained 1.5-mile (2.4-km) trail, with an elevation gain of 1280 feet (390 m) from the parking lot to the summit. Since it is the most accessible mountain to Anchorage, Flattop is a very popular location for hiking, climbing, berry picking, paragliding, and backcountry skiing. Campouts are held on the summit at the summer and winter solstices.
        </p>
            <p>
            Flattop is known for its panoramic views of Anchorage and the surrounding area; Denali, Mount Foraker, and Mount Spurr are sometimes visible on very clear days.</p>
